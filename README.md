## Misinformation Analysis
A project using unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to analyze the level of misinformation in articles.

### Dataset Acquisition
In order to properly use this project, the dataset files must be downloaded separately and moved to the /unsupervised/datasets/ and /supervised/datasets/ folders. These files are too large to be hosted on Github, and can instead be found here: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d52_oYKbRSw-JUYlJaHCkcbWAjPQv5wQ?usp=sharing).
